<h3>Recap</h3>
In the [last post]({{root_dir}}/blog/2013/12/27/realtime-maps-with-meteor-and-leaflet/), we initialized a Leaflet map to work with [Stamen Design](http://stamen.com/)'s [toner themed map tiles](http://maps.stamen.com/toner/#12/37.7706/-122.3782) and [Bootstrap's responsive layout](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/scaffolding.html#responsive). We then set up a double-click event handler to gather additional details about the proposed new party, and we hooked up the dialog's save button to pass those details to a ```Meteor.methods()``` call to save the party into a server-side mongo collection. Finally, we hooked up a ```cursor.observe()``` ```added()``` callback to a query on the client-side minimongo collection and set up the callback to automatically add a circular ```DivIcon``` marker at the specified coordinates. 

<h3>Updating Party Details in the Database</h3>
Each party contains an array of RSVP objects, which must be updated when any user updates their RSVP to the party. In addition, private parties contain a set of invited userIds. These are the twp mutable attributes of a party; the title, description, and coordinates cannot be updated as per the original example. In addition, a party's owner can delete the party if no user is RSVPd as Yes (Maybes don't count). The complete Party document looks like this:
``` js
{
  _id: "22dQwpajD64LCv4QW",
  title: "1871",
  description: "Party like it's 1871!",
  latlng: {
    lat: 41.88298161317542,
    lng:  -87.63811111450194
  },
  public: false,
  owner: "52xdsNjprquesL2tQ",
  invited: ["52xdsNjprquesL2tQ", "ci7bzkJCpH9R7HCZK", "5qhRdKFcsmPnxZKBr"]
  rsvps: [
    {
      rsvp: "yes",
      user: "52xdsNjprquesL2tQ"
    },
    {
      rsvp: "maybe",
      user: "ci7bzkJCpH9R7HCZK"
    }
  ]
}
```
The code to update and delete parties in the server-side mongo collection is virtually unchanged from the original. The ```invite()``` and ```rsvp()``` template event handlers are hooked to ```Meteor.methods()``` calls which perform the necessary checks before updating the collection. As usual, Meteor, behind the scenes, updates the client-side minimongo collection as soon as the server collection is updated.

<h3>Updating and Removing Map Markers in Realtime</h3>
Now it's time to add in the ```cursor.observe()``` ```changed()``` callback to set a new icon for the party's marker, and the ```removed()```  callback to delete the party's marker from the map as well as the local ```markers``` hash.

``` js
var map, markers = {};

Template.map.created = function() {
  Parties.find({}).observe({
    added: function(party) {/* see previous post */},
    changed: function(party) {
      var marker = markers[party._id];
      if (marker) marker.setIcon(createIcon(party));
    },
    removed: function(party) {
      var marker = markers[party._id];
      if (map.hasLayer(marker)) {
        map.removeLayer(marker);
        delete markers[party._id];
      }
    }
  });
}
```
<h3>Using a Halo Marker to Indicate Which Party Is Selected</h3>
{% imgcap right /images/custom/selected-party.png a selected party %} 

Up to this point, there's no visual indication _on the map_ as to which party is currently selected. Just like in the original Parties example, we solve this by creating a 50px x 50px transparent grey circular marker and making it concentric with the currently selected party's marker such that it forms a light halo around the selected party. This halo marker is purely a UI artefact that does not need to be saved on the server.

``` js
L.divIcon({
  iconSize: [50, 50],
  className: 'leaflet-animated-div-icon'
}
```
``` css
.leaflet-animated-div-icon {
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: none;
  opacity: .2;
  background: black;
}
```

<h3>Animating the Halo Marker</h3>
For the final flourish, we use the AnimatedMarker Leaflet plugin created by []() from OpenPlans to animate the marker as it moves about when a user selects different parties (rather than simply making it reappear at a different location). AnimatedMarker takes a Leaflet ```polyline``` object as the first argument to it's  initialize function, and draws the marker at the beginning of the polyline. It then animates the marker along the polyline at a speed (in meters/ms) that is configurable via a second options argument. 

We need to make a minor tweak to the plugin's source code to support our needs: The original AnimatedMarker does not allow setting of the animation polyline after the marker is initialized. As a result, AnimatedMarker requires the complete animation path to be known before creating the marker. But we want to create the AnimatedMarker once and to then set the animation polyline dynamically as soon as a user selects a different marker. The next animation polyline would be a single segment from the AnimatedMarker's current location to the center of the next marker selected. To accomplish this, I've had to reset the internal index (```this._i```) to 1 when a ```polyline``` is passed to the setLine method, making the method repeatedly reusable, rather than something that's called just once upon the marker's initialization. Until my pull request is merged, this modification is available at my fork on github.
